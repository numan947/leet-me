Finding bridges in an undirected graph is another graph algorithm, and it is often referred to as the "bridge-finding algorithm." A bridge in a graph is an edge that, if removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph. The algorithm is based on a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph.

Here's an explanation of the algorithm:

1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph, marking nodes as visited and assigning them a discovery time.
2. During the DFS traversal, keep track of the discovery time of each node and the earliest reachable ancestor (low value) for each node.
3. For each edge (u, v), check if the low value of the destination node (v) is greater than the discovery time of the source node (u). If so, the edge (u, v) is a bridge.

Now, let's implement this algorithm in Python:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, V):
        self.V = V  # Number of vertices
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]  # Adjacency list
        self.time = 0  # Time for DFS traversal
        self.bridges = []  # List to store bridges

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.adj[u].append(v)
        self.adj[v].append(u)

    def bridge_dfs(self, u, visited, disc, low, parent):
        visited[u] = True
        disc[u] = self.time
        low[u] = self.time
        self.time += 1

        for v in self.adj[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                self.bridge_dfs(v, visited, disc, low, u)

                low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

                if low[v] > disc[u]:
                    self.bridges.append((u, v))

            elif v != parent:
                low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

    def find_bridges(self):
        visited = [False] * self.V
        disc = [float("inf")] * self.V
        low = [float("inf")] * self.V

        for i in range(self.V):
            if not visited[i]:
                self.bridge_dfs(i, visited, disc, low, -1)

        return self.bridges

# Example usage:
g = Graph(5)
g.add_edge(1, 0)
g.add_edge(0, 2)
g.add_edge(2, 1)
g.add_edge(0, 3)
g.add_edge(3, 4)

print("Bridges in the graph:")
print(g.find_bridges())
```

This code defines a `Graph` class with methods to add edges and find bridges using the bridge-finding algorithm. The `find_bridges` method returns a list containing all the bridges in the graph. You can create a graph object, add edges to it, and then call the `find_bridges` method to get the bridges.
